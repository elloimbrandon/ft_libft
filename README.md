# Libft

This is our first project in the [42 Silicon Valley](http://42.us.org) curriculum. As incoming students, we're tasked with re-coding a set of standard ```libc``` functions, as defined by their man pages. We're also tasked with coding other useful functions from a given set of descriptions. As
we progress through future projects it is recommended and encouraged to add other useful functions to our library.

This project requires us to re-write these standard ```libc``` functions and other personal functions so that we may further understand and better implement them in our future C projects.

Per the project, all of our functions must begin with ```ft_``` for, _Forty-Two_.

**Project Document:**
[Libft.pdf](https://github.com/elloimbrandon/ft_libft/blob/master/docs/libft.en.pdf)

All functions were written according to 42's coding standard,
[the Norm](https://github.com/elloimbrandon/ft_libft/blob/master/docs/norme.en.pdf).


## Installation

Download the repository by copying and pasting the commands below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elloimbrandon/ft_libft.git
cd libft
```

You can compile the library using the Makefile:

Command       |  Action
:-------------|:-------------
`make`        | Compile the library.
`make clean`  | Remove object files.
`make fclean` | Remove object files and the library.
`make re`     | Re-compile the library.

## Usage

After compilation, the library can be used alongside your programs with the following command:

```bash
gcc libft.a -I ./header <your_file.c> -o <output_name>
```
